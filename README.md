# WheelView
SwiftUI view to create a game show style wheel using an input array. The wheel is generated by creating one segment at a time and then rotating the segment so that it creates a complete wheel. This can be used for any random spinning mechanism. For example,it can be used to populate an array of restaurants that the user spins and outputs a random restaurant. The wheel can be spun by adding a .rotationEffect to the view.
